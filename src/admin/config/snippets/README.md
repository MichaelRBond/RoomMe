Snippets
========

Snippets provide a very basic way to create webpages internal to the Room Reservation software. A simple WYSIWYG html editor is provided, as well as a Name field to name the snippet. Once a snippet is created there is an a *minus sign* and *arrow* next to the snipper name in the list. 

Clicking the *minus* sign will delete the snippet.

Clicking the *arrow* will expand a set o f informaiton. 

* Auth Required : This is a link to the snippet where the user will be required to authenticate before viewing the snippet. 
* Public : This is the link to the snippet that is viewable by the public without authentication. 
* The third bullet point is a preview of the snipper itself. 

Clicking on the title of the snippet will allow you to edit the snippet.
